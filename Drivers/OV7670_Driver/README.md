Never NULL err pointer in DEBUG mode!!

If you use PLL for other application, beware: the driver requires at least a 8 MHz PLL, with an optimal PLL frequency being 24 MHz.
Use PLLCLK to provide the module with a clock. Mention what can happen, what to pay attention to, etc.

Compatible with STM32F3xx family only.
Tested on STM32F303RE
